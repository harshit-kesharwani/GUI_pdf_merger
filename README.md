# GUI_pdf_merger

## **tkinter** which is an inbuilt Python module as we are creating GUI Application to merge PDFs

- In this online education system we often receive PDFs from teachers and find it difficult to open each of them and might face an issue of losing them 
- Ofcourse, there will be many online PDF mergers that are paid or free
- But preparing and using our own PDF merger is the true satisfaction 
- So I have decided to use one of my favourite language "Python" to create my own PDF merger
